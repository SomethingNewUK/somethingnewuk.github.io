## Meet Philip John

On 22nd February, part of Lichfield will elect new councillors onto Lichfield City Council and Lichfield District Council.

I’ve lived in Lichfield for over 11 years and I’m fed up of the same old political choices on the ballot paper. Electing a local councillor is important - the local councils care of things like refuse, parks, planning and more.

My decision to stand as a candidate was based on a desire for people to have more choices than the same parties who too often only appear around election time. People keep telling me they want a different choice, and they want a visible representative. That's what I'm here to be.

## No policies, just representation

Instead of a manifesto, Phil wants residents to tell him what their priorities are, and define the issues that he'll focus on as local councillor. He's delivering postcards to voters for them to complete with their priorities, or people can call (07516 816273), [e-mail](mailto:philip.john@somethingnew.org.uk) him or [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/philipjohn) to talk in person.

Even better, local people can simply use the poll below to vote for priorities, or add their own.
