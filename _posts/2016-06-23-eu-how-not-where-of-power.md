{: .tldr}
Focusing on where power lies distracts from what really matters - whether the system that grants that power is democratic. In that light, not only does it not matter that EU power is "in" Brussels, but that power has more legitimacy than the UK's democracy.

A common complaint of anti-EU campaigners is that the EU is too "remote" - that somehow the physical distance of the people and buildings of the EU has a direct impact on whether the democratic system they represent is legitimate.

There is certainly a benefit from feeling close to your elected representatives. If you can see them, and interact with them, you'll feel more able to exert your influence as a constituent. But that's a fairly intangible - it doesn't actually impact the underlying system.

So while MEPs may sit in Brussels, and our MPs may site in London, their location is of no consequence - what matters is how their power is given to them. While there are different systems, we can easily compare the two.

## Parliament

Our Parliament is composed of 650 MPs and 790 Lords. As Lords are appointed by the Government, that makes the UK Parliament 55% unelected.

By contrast, the European Parliament is 100% elected.

We also have to look at the voting system. The UK's 45% elected representatives are elected by a non-proportional system that [doesn't represent how the population votes](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-parliament-proportional-representation/20893).

The EU Parliament, however, has it's MEPs elected by a proportional system, making those elected members more representative of the voting intentions of the population than in the UK.

## Government

Here's how it works in the UK;

* Our government (aka the executive branch) is composed of MPs and Lords.
* These are appointed by a single person - the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs.
* This means that the ruling party can influence votes of the legislature (the Houses of Parliament) by appointing members to Government
* They can increase the number of Government ministers to increase that influence.

In the EU;

* The executive (the European Commission) is separate from the Parliament (MEPs), keeping MEPs independent and more able to hold the Commission to account.
* There are only 28 members of the Commission.
* Each member state of the EU chooses a single Commissioner.
* Those Commissioners are then subject to approval by our elected MEPs.

So it's easy to see how the EU has a structure that restricts the power of the executive far more that our own government is limited by our elected MPs.

## Legislation

In the UK, legislation can be proposed by MPs or Lords. This does mean that any of our elected representatives can propose laws, but so can that unelected 55% of our Parliament.

In the EU, only the Commission can propose new laws, although in order for them to make progress they need the support of both the elected MEPs in the Parliament, and the elected national governments of the European Council.

Here, the EU isn't as good as it could be - Parliament should be able to propose new laws, as well as the Commission. But it's also the case that the UK Government largely controls the schedule for Parliament and can therefore sideline proposals it doesn't support. Coupled with it's ability to heavily influence Parliament makes it unlikely that a non-Government bill will get a good chance of passing.

## How, not where

In these three crucial areas it's clear that the structure of the EU provides a far more democratic system than we have here in the UK. If we were to "take power back" from the EU, we'd be giving it to an institution that is demonstrably less democratic, and gives the Government of the day far too much power to do as it pleases.

The issue of "supremacy" often comes up in debates about the EU - the charge often being that EU law shouldn't prevail over national law. Given the EU law is clearly more democratic, not only should it's laws have supremacy, they are also more legitimate, thanks to the more representative system they spring from.

## Remain

Let's not take power away from a good - if imperfect - system and give it to a lesser system. Vote to Remain today.
