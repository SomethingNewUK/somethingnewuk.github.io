{: .tldr}
The chancellor published his spring budget for 2017 yesterday. Here's what we would have done instead.

## A fair and sustainable tax system

Philip Hammond was right to say that the difference in how the employed and self-employed are taxed represents an unfairness in the tax system. His response has been to increase taxation on those who are self-employed.

While it's ultimately necessary to increase the amount of tax paid by the self employed to match their salaried neighbours, this budget will hit those who already have strained finances. Our policy is also to [raise the minimum wage to that of a **real** living wage](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/economy#minimum-wage) and to also [raise the income tax threshold](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/economy#taxation) to match and track the living wage. Our policy would have ensured that while self-employed people are taxed more equally with salaried workers, they would not be unnecessarily penalised and have their finances squeezed further.

## Raising productivity and living standards

Instead of raising the personal allowance to £11,500 we would [elevate and lock it to the level of the living wage](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/economy#minimum-wage). It makes no sense for a government to acknowledge the living wage and then force people under it through taxation.

We reject the statement that "raising productivity – the amount of output per hour worked – is the only sustainable way to raise living standards for people across the UK." Living standards are based on a multitide of factors, including whether people are earning a living wage. We would ensure every employee gets a living wage - one single action that will instantly raise living standards for millions of people.

Improving education is important for improving our workforce and matching the demands of changing industry. Instead of "maintenance loans" we would ensure everyone has access to [free education to degree level or equivalent](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/education#funding).

We emphatically reject the chancellor's assertion that "choice is the key to excellence in education" and disagree with the expansion of the free schools programme. "Choice" in the education system is, unfortunately, a euphemism for de-regulation of state education. We would instead end the free schools program and restore local education authorities and bring all state-funded schools under LEAs with a national curriculum designed and implemented by expert teachers.

Furthermore, we would [spend at least 0.8% of GDP on scientific research and development](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/science#science-funding), [fund continuing eduction](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/education#continuing-education) and introduce a [national investment bank](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/economy#national-investment-bank).

## Building an economy that works for everyone

An increase in free childcare for 3-4 year olds is very welcome, and we would expand this to non-working households too, to give out of work parents the opportunity to seek work or education opportunities.

Injecting £2bn into councils over 3 years for social care, and £425m for A&E is nowhere near enough to resolve the health and social care crisis, we would repeal the Health & Social Care Act and inject £5bn into health and social care immediately. Our policy of [nuclear disarmament](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/foreign_policy#nuclear-disarmament) would more than pay for the NHS we need.

While building an economy that works for everyone sounds good, it is empty rhetoric from a government that has consistently cut taxes, starving our public services of desparately needed funds. We will restore corporation tax rates to their 2010 levels and work towards equalisation with personal income tax rates for a fairer tax system.

## A Fair Economy

Something New believe that markets are a tool for society and that a strong and courageous state is necessary to limit the excesses of capitalism and ensure public services meet the needs of society.
