title: Code of Conduct
---

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and [party officers][officers] pledge to making participation in our party and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

[Party officers][officers] are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

[Party officers][officers] and community moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the party or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official party e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the party may be
further defined and clarified by [party officers][officers].

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the [party officers][officers] at [info@somethingnew.org.uk](mailto:info@somethingnew.org.uk). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The [party officers][officers] are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

[Party officers][officers] who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the party's leadership.
