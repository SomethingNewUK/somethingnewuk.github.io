          Because we want everyone to be able to take part, you don't have to 
          pay anything if you don't want to. <a href="https://subscriptions.zoho.com/subscribe/8cef313466ac657e4c0370e9ea55ae6f6a2bba0f6b053217afe8ded60e8a6aa6/monthly-membership">Click here</a> to join without setting
          up a donation. Unfortunately, at the moment our membership system needs payment details even for free memberships, but you won't be charged anything.
        </p>

          If you're not a UK registered voter, choose this option as we
          can't accept your donation anyway.

<h3>FAQs</h3>

<h4>It's free? How does that work?</h4>
<p>
We believe everyone in the UK should be able to take part in building a better 
democracy, so membership of Something New is completely free. Intead, we ask that
you set up a regular donation when you join to help support our costs.
</p>

<h4>What do I get?</h4>
<p>
Everything we do is open to all; there is nothing special that members get access to.
Instead it's about making a statement, and helping to build a better future. You will need
to be a member if you want to stand for election or as a party officer, though.
</p>

<h4>I'm already a member of the X party, can I join?</h4>
<p>
We don't mind if you are a member of another party - in fact, we encourage collaboration!
Your other party might have a problem with it though; check their rules.
</p>

<h4>How do I cancel my membership?</h4>
<p>
Easy! Log in to the <a href='https://subscriptions.zoho.com/portal/somethingnew/'>subscription portal</a>, 
click subscriptions in the menu, choose your active subscription and then press the cancel button.
</p>
<p>
You should have been sent an email when you joined to set up a password for the subscription portal;
if you didn't, email <a href='mailto:info@somethingnew.org.uk'>info@somethingnew.org.uk</a> and we'll help.
