So you want to help us build a new kind of politics? Great - there's lots to do! Check out some of the specific roles we're looking for below. Or, if none of those are suitable, [introduce yourself](https://discourse.somethingnew.org.uk/t/introduce-yourself/31/54) and tell us what you're good at.

* [Treasurer](#treasurer)

## Treasurer

As party treasurer, you would be helping us with one of the most crucial aspects of running a small political party. Much of our efforts are focused on fundraising, and there are various rules that we must abide by when fundraising as well as spending that money. As treasurer you'll be helping us to;

* ensure our fundraising efforts are legal,
* collect all the relevant data we need to from donators,
* properly report donations to the relevant authorities,
* arrange publication of all our donations (becase we're open!),
* ensure all our spending is legal and logged,
* publicise our spending (you guessed it - open!),
* report our spending as required by relevant authorities.
* plan future spending, setting and tracking budgets for election campaigns,
* authorising election spending.

## National Campaign Manager

When we run national campaigns, such general election or specific issue campaigns, we'll need someone to co-ordinate everything. This could include;

* managing campaign-specific roles and responsibilities,
* working with the treasurer on fundraising,
* co-ordinating local campaign managers where necessary,
* making sure the communications campaign is on track by working with the communications manager,
* setting budgets with the treasurer and making sure all spending is recorded.

Depending on how many people are available for a campaign, the campaign manager might be a very hands-on role, so one of the tasks of a campaign manager is to recruit new volunteers!

## Local Campaign Managers

Much like the national campaign manager, a local campaign manager helps run the campaign but on a local level. Typically the local campaign manager will be the election agent for a candidate, which has [specific legal requirements](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/candidate-or-agent), but that's not always the case. A local campaign manager will;

* manage a candidate's to-do list,
* work with the communications manager to run communications with local media,
* tracking spending and making sure it's inline with the budget, and properly recorded,

## Policy Researchers

Our manifesto, full of contributions by lots of different people, while full of great contributions, still has a lot of gaps. We're looking for people to research specific policy areas that we're currently missing and form a suggestion that can be contributed to the manifesto. There's a [bunch of policy areas](https://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk/ideas) ready to explore, and your research should;

* look for the evidence,
* take in multiple points of view and published research,
* produce a policy proposal that meets the manifesto principles.

## Communications Manager

When we run campaigns, getting the message out is one of the most important things. Working with the campaign manager, a communications manager will;

* collate a list of press contacts,
* write and distribute press releases,
* get and stay in touch with relevant journalists to help ensure we get adequate press coverage,
* arrange interviews and hustings, where appropriate, for candidates,
* co-ordinate social media strategy.

## Social Media Manager

During a campaign, social media is one of our most powerful tools and it can easily take up a lot of time, so we're keen to have one individual take care of it. A social media manager will;

* work with the communications manager on overall strategy,
* help election candidates with social media coverage, including any training and set-up needs,
* monitor social media channels and engage where appropriate,
* develop our own "shareable" to try and encourage people to share our message.
