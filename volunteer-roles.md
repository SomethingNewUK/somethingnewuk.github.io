## Treasurer

As party treasurer, you would be helping us with one of the most crucial aspects of running a small political party. Much of our efforts are focused on fundraising, and there are various rules that we must abide by when fundraising as well as spending that money. As treasurer you'll be helping us to;

* ensure our fundraising efforts are legal,
* collect all the relevant data we need to from donators,
* properly report donations to the relevant authorities,
* arrange publication of all our donations (becase we're open!),
* ensure all our spending is legal and logged,
* publicise our spending (you guessed it - open!),
* report our spending as required by relevant authorities.
* plan future spending, setting and tracking budgets for election campaigns,
* authorising election spending.

Interested in this role? Let us know by e-mailing [info@somethingnew.org.uk](mailto:info@somethingnew.org.uk) with a little bit about you, any relevant experience and why you're interested. We **will** respond!
